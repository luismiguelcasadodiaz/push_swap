       [1m-u[22m, [1m--unique[0m

              output version information and exit

       KEYDEF  is  F[.C][OPTS][,F[.C][OPTS]] for start and stop position, where F is a field number and C a character position in the field; both are origin 1, and the stop position de‚Äê
       faults to the line‚Äôs end.  If neither [1m-t [22mnor [1m-b [22mis in effect, characters in a field are counted from the beginning of the preceding whitespace.  OPTS is one or more single-letter
       ordering options [bdfgiMhnRrV], which override global ordering options for that key.  If no key is given, use the entire line as the key.  Use [1m--debug [22mto diagnose  incorrect  key
       usage.

       SIZE may be followed by the following multiplicative suffixes: % 1% of memory, b 1, K 1024 (default), and so on for M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y.

       *** WARNING *** The locale specified by the environment affects sort order.  Set LC_ALL=C to get the traditional sort order that uses native byte values.
